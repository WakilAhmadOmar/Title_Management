# Title Management Application

A frontend web application that interacts with an Express backend to manage user authentication and allow users to create and read titles suggested by users. The application integrates MetaMask for cryptocurrency wallet functionality.

- Authenticate using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- Manage titles: view, add, and delete titles.
- Connect their MetaMask wallet to interact with the platform.

## Features
